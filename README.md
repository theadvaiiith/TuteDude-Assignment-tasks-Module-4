Task 1 – Factorial Calculation:
This program defines a function called factorial that takes a number as input and calculates its factorial using recursion. It checks for the base case (0 or 1) and multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one. The function is then called with a sample number, and the result is printed using an f-string. For example, if the input is 5, the output will be The factorial of 5 is: 120.

Task 2 – Math Module Operations:
This program defines a function that takes a number as input and uses the math module to perform three operations: calculate the square root, compute the natural logarithm (base e), and find the sine of the number (in radians). The user is prompted to enter a number, and the results are printed using formatted f-strings. For instance, if the input is 25, it shows the square root (5.0), logarithm, and sine value accordingly.
